# timezone

This is a small R package that implements the function `find_tz`, which can be used to find the TZ timezone name that corresponds to the given geographic coordinates.

The package uses offline shapefiles built from Open Street Map to determine the appropriate timezone name. The shapefiles and the tools to generate them are maintained by Evan Siroky at https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder . The package additionally implements functionality that uses the Google Maps API to find the timezone name (Note that this API limits you to a maximum of 2500 requests per day).

## Examples

```r
library(timezone)

# Los Angeles - 34.0522° N, 118.2428° W
find_tz(-118.2428,34.0522)
find_tz(-118.2428,34.0522, use_google=TRUE)

# Edinburgh - 55.9500° N, 3.2200° W
find_tz(cbind(-3.2200, 55.9500))

# Istanbul - 41.0128° N, 28.9744° E
find_tz(SpatialPoints(cbind(28.9744,41.0128)))
```
